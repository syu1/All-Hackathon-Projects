I CREID MORE LAST NIGHT FOR THE LOSS OF OPPORTUNITY
THAN DID WHEN MY FATHER SHOT HIMSELF
I PEE
IN THE UTILITY TUB
SOME SEEMINGLY INNOCUOUS ANCEDOTE ABOUT A PERSONAL BEHAVIOR
CONFESSION OF HIDDEN TRUTH REVEALING DARKER MOTIVATIONS FOR THAT SEEMINGLY INNOCUOUS BEHAVIOR
SOMETIMES I DELAY FEEDING MY CATS
BECAUSE I LIKE HOW AFFECTIONATE THEY ARE WHEN THEY'RE HUNGRY
TODAY IS THE DAY TO RECOVER FROM MY BLISSFUL ESCAPE
WHILE I APATHETICALLY WORK ON THE COMPUTER FOR THE NEXT 18-20 HOURS
I WRITE CUSTOM GIFT NOTES ON MY ONLINE ORDERS PRETENDING TO BE A PRIOR CUSTOMER LOYALTY REWARD
BECAUSE IM A SHOPAHOLIC AND I NEED AN EXCUSE IF MY SO FIND THE DELIVERY BOX BEFORE I DO
MY CLIENTS THINK PROGRAMMING IS HARD AND DELAYS ARE NORMAL
IM ACTUALLY IN SO MUCH PAIN ITS EASIER TO SAY I RAN INTO A BUG THAN ADMIT I NEEDED A LONG NAP
BROTHER IS REPLACING ALL MY PC GEAR WITH RAZER STUFF

I TELL CUSTOMERS THAT THEIR CABLE IS CANCELLED
BUT I DONT CANCEL IT
I DESIGN ALL THE WINDSHEILD WASHER FLUID TANKS
THAT ONLY HOLD 1 GALLON
SOMETIMES I SEEA MEME I ENJOY AND GO TO UPVOTE IT
THEN I REALIZE IT HAS BEEN POSTED FOR RIDICULE FOR BEING LAME AND CRINGEY AND MY OPINION OF IT CHANGES
SOMETIMES WHEN IM SAD
I GO TO HAPPY AND DOWNVOTE POSTS
WHEN SOMEONE LEAVES THEIR THINGS UNLOCKED IN A LOCKER
I LEAVE THE DOOR WIDE OPEN SO THEY THINK SOMEONE STOLE SOMETHING
I MAKE LISTS OF THINGS TO TALK ABOUT IN PERSON WITH MY SO
BECAUSE WERE BOTH REALLY BAD AT SMALL TALK
AS AN AVID FOOTBALL FAN I HATE SUPER BOWL SUNDAY
ITS JUST A REMINDER FOR HOW LITTLE FRIENDS I HAVE FOR HOW LITTLE FRIENDS I HAVE WHEN I WATCH THE GAME ALONE
I ALWAYS PUT THE SEAT DOWN 
AND THE LID
I GAVE A BOX OF CHOCOLATES GIFTED TO ME BY A STUDENT TO MY SO
AND PLAYED IT OFF AS IF IT WAS FROM ME
MY BOSS THINKS I COME IN EARLY EVETY MORNING BECAUSE IM A DEDICATED EMPLYEE

MY NEIGHBOR ARE ALWAYS LOUD ON THEIR BALCONY LATE AT NIGHT
IVE BEEN SPRAYING LIQUID ASS ON THEIR RALING WHEN I GET HOME FROM
IVE HAD MY PHONE FOR TWO YEARS
I STILL ONLY CLICK JUST ONCE WHEN IT ASKS ME WHAT PROGRAM TO USE TO OPEN SOMETHING
HIGH ON HEROIN THINKIGN ITS SAFE TO DRIVE I BLACKED OUT IN SOMEONES DRIVEWAY
UPON WAKING IN THE MORNING I IMMEDIATLEY ASSUMED THAT I MURDERED MY FAMILY
I WROTE ON FACEBOOK THAT I WAS GOING FOR A RUN TO SEE HOW FAST I WAS
WHEN I GOT BACK FROM A SLOW GRUELING RUN I REALIZED I HAD WRITTEN TO SEE HOW FAT I WAS
MY WIFES CHURCH IS SUPER RELIGIOUS AND SOMETIMES SPEAKS IN TONGUES
WHEN I GO I JUST PRETEND IM SPEAKING PARSELTOUNGUE
IM A SINGLE GUY BUT IM LOOKING FORWARD TO VALENTINES DAY
BECAUSE SOME GREAT CHOCOLATES ARE GOING TO BE ON SALE AFTERWARDS
JUST FOUND OUT THE COMPANY CEO IS ON HOLIDAY IN THE CARRIBEAN FOR 3 WEEKS
IM GONNA TAKE AN EXTRA LONG POOP TODAY
MY MUM THINKS IM PARANOID ABOUT MISSING FLIGHTS
ACTUALLY ID JUST RATHER SIT ALONE ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE CUSTOMS THAN SPEND MORE TIME WITH THEM
I DIDNT REALLY FORGET THE SALT FOR THE WATER SOFTENER WHEN I WAS AT THE STORE
I WAS TIRED AND IT LOOKED HEAVY
MY DEAF BROTHER WATCHES A LOT OF FORTNITE
I MAXED THE VOLUME ON HIS PC
I CANT STOP STARTING
AT OTHER PEOPLES BUTTS
BEFORE DATING I HAD A MUTAL CRUSH ON MY WIFE AND ANOTHER CLOSE FRIEND
I PICKED MY WIFE BECAUSE THE OTHER WOMAN HAD A BOYFRIEND AT THE TIME 9 YEARS LATER IM CONVINCED I MADE THE WRONG CHOICE
TOLD MY NEW COWORKERS I DIDNT UNDERSTAND MEMES
JUST SO THEYD QUIT SHOWING ME THEIR CRAPPY MEMES
LAST WEEK I TOLD MY LEAD THAT I WAS COMING FOR HIS JOB
FRIDAY MY LEAD WENT TO LUNCH GOT INTO AN ACCIDENT AND ONLY THE PROJECT MANAGER SURVIVED TODAY I WAS NAMED LEAD
MY DAD COMPLAINS THAT HIS DEVICES CONTANTLY DROP FROM MY WIFI
I BLOCKED THEM SO HE IS FORCED TO PAY ATTENTION TO HIS GRANDKIDS
IM GLAD PEOPLE SHOW THEMSELVES CLORING THEIR OWN HAIR ON INSTAGRAM
IT BRINGS MORE PEOPLE INTO MY CHAIR BECAUSE THEY NEED SOMEONE TO FIX IT AFTER ATTEMPTING THE SAME THING
I CATCALL ATTRACTIVE WOMEN
FROM INSIDE MY CAR WITH THE WINDOWS CLOSED WHERE THEY CANT HEAR ME
I ENJOY SPENDING TIME WITH MY SO
BUT I MISS PLAYING VIDEO GAMES
